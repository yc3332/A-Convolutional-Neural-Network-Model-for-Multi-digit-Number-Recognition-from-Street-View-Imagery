# Description of our project
A deep convolutional neural network has been designed and implemented to recognize multi-digit number from street view imagery in this project. The overall structure of the CNN designed in this paper is derived from the model discussed in the paper published by Ian J. Goodfellow, et al. In order to optimize the accuracy of testing result, hyper-parameters such as size of convolutional layer have been tuned.  To further discuss the performance of our CNN model, it is expected to train with more data to see whether the final accuracies can reach ones given in Goodfellowâ€™s paper with the same dataset.
